Returning to school after an exhilarating trip to Europe has been a bittersweet experience. As I step foot on campus once again, a wave of familiarity washes over me. The bustling hallways, the sound of conversations echoing, and the scent of freshly brewed coffee from the student center all serve as a reminder that a new semester awaits.

Reconnecting with Ray, Samuel, and other friends brings a sense of comfort and normalcy. We share stories of our adventures abroad, swapping tales of the most awe-inspiring sights and the unforgettable moments we experienced. It's as if our journey through Europe has woven an unbreakable bond between us, further solidifying our friendship.

However, there is also a tinge of sadness, a longing for the freedom and excitement of travel. The memories of the places we explored and the people we met linger in my mind, fueling a desire for more adventures beyond the confines of campus life. Yet, I remind myself that this return marks the beginning of a new chapter, filled with opportunities to learn, grow, and make the most of my education.
